## Our goal to help raise money for the people of Tenderloin in SF

It is our humble goal to raise money for the tenderloin in San Francisco. We are humbled by the effort of the local communities that have contributed to the homeless situation in SF. With rising prices and sky high inflation, soon we will be unable to support those on the streets. Your kind donation will help in the following ways:

- food and shelter for those in need
- funds to help each person get access to a shower
- clean the streets and give them clean access to medical supplies
- connect them to the nearest medical care
- blankets for when it is too cold outside

### Phase 1 (June 2022)

*Rolling out volunteers* - with the help of volunteers we see a clear path to helping homeless people in need.  

### Phase 2 (July 2022)

**Longer term we want a more systemic change to poverty** -- We want to give people the podium to learn and help them voice their opinions to the systems that are currently oppressive to the lowest earning members of society. 

### Phase 3 (October 2022)

*As we have more support* -- we plan to mobilize more support with the help of California's governer, Gavin Newsom and London Breed in our effort to empower homeless people and reduce crime on the streets. 

## Final Note

```We hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards. Your donation will go a long way and we want to update you on this platform by posting updates on how your pledges on any cadence helps us make progress towards our goals above. We believe together we can end the systemic oppression which inevitably will be accelarated by inflation but we are focused on setting up processes and systems to counter the effects. ```
